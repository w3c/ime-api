      <p>This specification defines an &ldquo;IME API&rdquo; that provides
        Web applications with scripted access to an IME
        (<a href="#IME">input-method editor</a>) associated with
        a hosting user agent. This IME API includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An <a>InputMethodContext</a> interface, which provides
            attributes, events, and methods to interact
            with current UI state of IME.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>This API is designed to be used in conjunction with UI Events
        [[UI-EVENTS]].</a></p>

        This document is a proposal that is being made available for public

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Even though existing Web-platform APIs allow developers to implement
        very complicated Web applications, such as visual chat applications or
        WYSIWYG presentation editors, developers have difficulties when
        implementing Web applications that involve
        <a href="#IME">input-method editors</a>.
        To mitigate the difficulties, the UI Events
          specification [[UI-EVENTS]]
        introduces <i>composition events</i>
        to retrieve <a href="#ime-composition">composition text</a>
        while it is being composed in an associated IME.</p>
      <p>However, Web applications can still run into difficulties
        interacting with IME, such as detecting any UI overlap between
        <a href="#candidate-window">IME candidate window</a> and its
        underlying UI elements.</p>
      <p>To solve the IME-related problems, this specification introduces
        an IME API that allows Web applications to interact with the IME.
        This specification introduces <a>InputMethodContext</a> interface.</p>
      <p>There are also proposed standards related to IME:
        <ul>
          <li>Changing IME mode via CSS
        (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-ui/#ime-mode">ime-mode property
        in CSS3 UI</a>)
          <li>Controlling generic input modality
            (<a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/association-of-controls-and-forms.html#input-modalities:-the-inputmode-attribute">inputmode attribute in HTML spec</a>)
        </ul>
        They can work independently of this API.
      </p>
      <p>Please also refer to the separate
        <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/ime-api/raw-file/default/use-cases/Overview.html">use cases for Input Method Editor
          API </a>document for more information about possible use cases.</p>

        as a non-normative reference.</p>

      <p>This example is a simple web search page which gives a user
        search query suggestions while the user is doing composition.

      <h1>Background: What’s an Input Method Editor?</h1>
      <p>An <dfn id="IME">IME</dfn> (input-method editor) is an application
        that allows a standard keyboard (such as a US-101 keyboard) to be used
        to type characters and symbols that are not directly represented on the
        keyboard itself. In China, Japan, and Korea, IMEs are used ubiquitously
        to enable standard keyboards to be employed to type the very large
        number of characters required for writing in Chinese, Japanese, and
        Korean.</p>
      <p>On platforms with touch-based input device such as mobile phones,
        an IME also plays a role to type text that a simple on-screen keyboard
        cannot type directly.</p>
      <p>A <dfn id="system-ime">system IME</dfn> is an IME already installed
        on a user's system.
      <p>An IME consists of two modules; a <a href="#composer">composer</a>
        and a <a href="#converter">converter</a>.</p>

      <p>A <dfn id="composer">composer</dfn> is a context-free parser that
        composes non-ASCII characters (including phonetic characters) from
        keystrokes, e.g. Hiragana or Pinyin.</p>
      <p>A <dfn id="converter">converter</dfn> is a context-sensitive parser
        that looks up a dictionary to convert phonetic characters to
        a set of ideographic characters, e.g. Kanji.</p>
      <p>An <dfn id="ime-clause">IME clause</dfn> is a grammatical word
        produced in an IME.</p>
      <p>An <dfn id="ime-selected-clause">IME selected clause</dfn> is an
        <a href="#ime-clause">IME clause</a> currently being converted by
        an IME.</p>
      <p>An <dfn id="ime-composition">IME composition</dfn>
        is an instance of text produced in an IME. For IMEs that can produce
        multiple words, an IME composition consists of multiple IME clauses.
        For IMEs that produce only one word, an IME composition is equal to an
        IME clause.</p>

      <p>When an IME receives keystrokes, it sends the keystrokes to a
        composer and receives phonetic characters matching to the keystrokes.
        When an IME receives phonetic characters from a composer, it sends the
        phonetic characters to a converter and receives the list of ideographic
        characters matching to the phonetic characters. The following figure
        shows the basic structure of an IME.</p>

      <section id="composer-section">
        <h1>Composer</h1>
        <p>A composer consists of two types of composers: a
        <a href="#phonetic-composer">phonetic composer</a>
        and a
        <a href="#radical-composer">radical composer</a>.</p>

        <p>A <dfn id="phonetic-composer">phonetic composer</dfn> composes a phonetic
        character from its ASCII representation.</p>

        <p>A <dfn id="radical-composer">radical composer</dfn> composes a
        phonetic character from <a href="#phonetic-radical">phonetic radicals</a>.</p>

        <p>A <dfn id="phonetic-radical">phonetic radical</dfn> is a character
          component of a Latin character, a Chinese character, or a Korean
          character. A Latin character can consist of an ASCII character and
          accent marks, e.g. the character &lsquo;&aacute;&rsquo; consists of
          the ASCII character &lsquo;a&rsquo; and the accent mark
          &lsquo;&acute;&rsquo;. A Chinese character can consist of Chinese
          character components that refer to its semantic origins, e.g. the
          Chinese character &lsquo;&#x7565;&rsquo; consists of two components
          &lsquo;&#x7530;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&#x5404;&rsquo;. A Korean
          character consists of Korean character components that represent
          consonants or vowels, e.g. the Korean character
          &lsquo;&#xac00;&rsquo; consists of the consonant
          &lsquo;&#x3131;&rsquo; and the vowel &lsquo;&#x314f;&rsquo;.</p>

        <p>A <dfn id="composition-window">composition window</dfn> is a window
          that shows ASCII characters being composed by
          <a href="#phonetic-composer">phonetic composers</a> or
          <a href="#phonetic-radical">phonetic radicals</a> being composed by
          <a href="#radical-composer">radical composers</a>.</p>

        <p>An IME usually shows the text being composed by a composer with its
          own style to distinguish it from the existing text. Even though most
          of composers output phonetic characters, some composers (such as
          Bopomofo composers) output a placeholder character
          instead of phonetic characters while composing text.</p>

        <section id="phonetic-composer-section">
          <h3>Phonetic Composer</h3>
          <p>Phonetic composers are not only used for typing Simplified
            Chinese and Japanese, but also used for typing non-ASCII
            characters (such as mathematical symbols, Yi, Amharic, etc.) with
            a US-101 keyboard. Each of these languages has a mapping table
            from its character to a sequence of ASCII characters representing
            its pronunciation: e.g.,
            &lsquo;&#x304B;&rsquo; to &lsquo;ka&rsquo; in Japanese, and;
            &lsquo;&#x5361;&rsquo; to &lsquo;ka&rsquo; in Simplified Chinese.
            This mapping table is called as Romaji for Japanese and Pinyin for
            Simplified Chinese, respectively. A phonetic composer uses these
            mapping tables to compose a phonetic character from a sequence of
            ASCII characters produced by a US keyboard.</p>
          <p>An example of a phonetic composer for Simplified Chinese outputs
            the ASCII characters that were input by the user, as its
            composition text.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>On the other hand, a typical phonetic composer for Japanese
            outputs phonetic characters when the typed ASCII characters have
            corresponding phonetic characters.</p>

          <h3>Radical Composer</h3>
          <p>Radical composers are mainly used for typing Traditional
            Chinese and Korean with phonetic keyboards. Each phonetic
            keyboard of these languages can produce phonetic radicals:
            e.g., typing &lsquo;r&rsquo; produces &lsquo;&#x3131;&rsquo;
            on a Korean keyboard; typing &lsquo;o&rsquo; produces
            &lsquo;&#x4EBA;&rsquo; on a Traditional-Chinese (or Bopomofo)
            keyboard, etc. A radical composer composes a phonetic
            character from phonetic radicals given by these keyboards:
            e.g., typing &lsquo;&#x3131;&rsquo; (r) and &lsquo;&#x314F;&rsquo;
            (k) produces &lsquo;&#xAC00;&rsquo; on a Korean keyboard;
            typing &lsquo;&#x4EBA;&rsquo; (o), &lsquo;&#x5F13;&rsquo; (n), and
            &lsquo;&#x706B;&rsquo; (f) produces &lsquo;&#x4F60;&rsquo; on a
            Traditional-Chinese keyboard, etc.</p>
          <p>A radical composer for Korean outputs the phonetic radicals as
            its composition text.</p>

            <figcaption>Radical composer (Korean)</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>A radical composer for Traditional Chinese outputs a
            placeholder character (U+3000) and shows the phonetic radicals
            being composed to its own window. This window is an example
            of a composition window.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Some platforms (such as Mac and Linux) use radical composers
            for typing accented characters used in European countries.
            For example,
            typing &lsquo; &#x308; &rsquo; (option+u) and &lsquo;a&rsquo; (a)

        <h2>Converter</h2>
        <p>A converter is a context-sensitive parser used for replacing
          the outputs of a composer to ideographic characters on Chinese,
          Japanese, and Korean.</p>
        <p class="note">Korean seldom uses ideographic characters.</p>

        <p>Because Chinese, Japanese, and Korean have many homonyms, each
          sequence of phonetic characters usually matches many ideographic
          characters: e.g., a Japanese
          phonetic character &lsquo;&#x304B;&rsquo; matches Japanese
          ideographic characters
          &lsquo;&#x5316;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&#x79D1;&rsquo;,
          &lsquo;&#x8AB2;&rsquo;,
          etc.; Pinyin characters &lsquo;ka&rsquo; matches Simplified-Chinese
          ideographic characters &lsquo;&#x5361;&rsquo;,
          &lsquo;&#x5580;&rsquo;,
          &lsquo;&#x54AF;&rsquo;, etc.; Bopomofo characters
          &lsquo;&#x4EBA;&#x5F13;&rsquo; matches Traditional-Chinese
          ideographic characters &lsquo;&#x4E5E;&rsquo;,
          &lsquo;&#x4EBF;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&#x4E87;&rsquo;, etc.</p>
        <p>A converter looks up a dictionary and shows a list of
          candidates of possible ideographic characters so a user can choose
          one. This list is known as a <dfn id="candidate-list">candidate
            list</dfn>.
          A candidate list is known as a <dfn id="candidate-window">candidate
            window</dfn> when it has its own window.</p>
        <p>Some Japanese IMEs show annotations in its
          <a href="#candidate-window">candidate window</a>
          for a character that is not so easy to distinguish from other
          characters (such as full-width alphabets, full-width Katakanas,
          and half-width Katakanas, etc.), as shown in the following
          figure.</p>
        <figure id="fig-candidate-window-japanese">

          <figcaption>Candidate window (Japanese)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The next figure shows a <a href="#candidate-window">candidate
            window</a> of a Simplified-Chinese IME.</p>
        <figure id="fig-candidate-window-simplified-chinese">

          <figcaption>Candidate window (Simplified Chinese)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>And the next figure shows a <a href="#candidate-window">candidate
            window</a> of a Traditional-Chinese IME.</p>
        <figure id="fig-candidate-window-traditional-chinese">
          <p><img height="180" src="images/image06.png" width="352"></p>
          <figcaption>Candidate window (Traditional Chinese)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Some techniques are used to improve conversion quality.
          For example, a converter integrates an <dfn id="MRU">MRU</dfn>
          (Most-Recently Used) list.
          Even though there are many ideographic characters for each phonetic
          character (or phonetic radical), a user does not usually use all
          these ideographic characters. A converter uses an
          <a href="#MRU">MRU list</a> to filter out ideographic characters not
          used so often from a <a href="#candidate-list">candidate list</a>.
          Another example is a grammar parser. A converter that
          integrates a grammar parser splits the given phonetic characters
          into grammatical clauses and converts only one clause at a time.
          When a sequence of phonetic characters consists of n clauses and the
          i-th clause has m_i candidates, the total number of the candidates
          for the input characters becomes (m_1 * m_2 * &hellip; * m_n).
          To reduce the number of candidates owned by a converter,
          a converter usually processes one clause at a time. This clause is
          called the <dfn id="selected-clause">selected clause</dfn>.</p>

        <p>An IME usually renders a <a href="#selected-clause">selected
            clause</a> with a special style to distinguish it from other
          clauses, as shown in the following figure.</p>
        <figure id="fig-selected-clause">
          <p><img height="346" src="images/image08.png" width="394"></p>
          <figcaption>Selected clause (Japanese)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>When a converter converts two or more clauses, it chooses
          candidates for the selected clause so it becomes grammatically
          consistent with the surrounding clauses:
          e.g., Japanese converters usually output
          &lsquo;&#x5371;&#x6A5F;&#x4E00;&#x9AEA;&rsquo; (not
          &lsquo;&#x5371;&#x6A5F;&#x4E00;&#x767A;&rsquo;)
          for Japanese phonetic characters
          &lsquo;&#x304D;&#x304D;&#x3044;&#x3063;&#x3071;&#x3064;&rsquo;
          because
          &lsquo;&#x5371;&#x6A5F;&#x4E00;&#x767A;&rsquo; is grammatically
          incorrect.</p>
        <p>On a mobile platform, candidates may not appear in a separate
          window, but occupy some part of the screen for the user to choose
          the candidate word that they intend as a part of on-screen keyboard.

      <h1>The inputMethodContext property</h1>
      <p>Authors can get an object which implements the
        <a>InputMethodContext</a>
        interface on an editable
        element, which can get keyboard input first
        (i.e. a &ldquo;target&rdquo; element).
        If this property is accessed
        on a non-editable element, a user agent SHOULD
        return a context for the innermost editable or focusable element
        to the element.  In this case, the <code>target</code> property
        in the <a>InputMethodContext</a>
        interface points to the target element.
        If all ancestors of an element are neither editable nor focusable,
        this property returns <code>null</code>.</p>
      <p>To control the IME attached to an element, it is a good idea to add
        this property to the HTMLElement interface.</p>
      <dl title="partial interface HTMLElement" class="idl">
        <dt>readonly attribute InputMethodContext? inputMethodContext</dt>
          <dd>

              this element.</p>
            <p>To change the behavior of the IME associated with an
              element, authors MUST first obtain an <a>InputMethodContext</a>
              interface from the <code>inputMethodContext</code> property of
              the HTMLElement interface.</p>
            <p>The returned <a>InputMethodContext</a> interface MAY not be directly
              associated to the element.  An interface MAY be shared
              among elements under an innermost editable or focusable element.
              In that case, <code>target</code> property in the
              <a>InputMethodContext</a> interface points to the element which owns
              the interface.</p>

      <p>Any access to the <a>InputMethodContext</a> interface makes sense
