        This is a non-normative document that provides background
        information relevant to the proposed
        <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/ime-api/raw-file/default/Overview.html">IME API</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>An IME (input-method editor) is an application
      that allows a standard keyboard (such as a US-101 keyboard) to be used to
      type characters and symbols that are not directly represented on the
      keyboard itself. In China, Japan, and Korea, IMEs are used ubiquitously to
      enable standard keyboards to be employed to type the very large number
      of characters required for writing in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.</p>

      <p>Web-application developers currently encounter a number of
      <b>problems, pain points, and shortcomings related to interaction with
      operating-system IMEs</b>.
      The
      <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/ime-api/raw-file/default/Overview.html">IME API</a>
      addresses those issues, and this document describes use cases to which the IME API
      is applicable in addressing those issues.
    </section>
    <section id="use-cases">
      <h2>Use cases</h2>
      <p>This section lists some use cases for the
        <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/ime-api/raw-file/default/Overview.html">IME API</a>.

    <section id="games">
      <h2>[games] Prevent system IME from interfering with games</h2>
      <p>A user who is playing a Web-based game might
      inadvertently press a key combination that would suddenly cause an
      <a href="#system-ime">system IME</a>
      to be invoked and then also possibly cause an IME
      <a href="#candidate-window">candidate window</a>
      to appear in the midst of that game. That wouldn’t be what the user
      would expect.
      <p><b>Requirement</b>: Developers of Web-based game should have a way
      prevent the system IME from being invoked during a game.
      <p>This use case in similar to the use case for providing the
      proposed 
      <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2012JanMar/0402.html">Screen Orientation Lock</a>
      API, or even the
      <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/pointerlock/raw-file/default/index.html">Pointer Lock</a> API,
      in that game developer should have a way to “lock” (out) the system
      IME behavior while the user is playing the game.
    </section>
    <section id="suggest">
      <h2>[suggest] Prevent system IME from interfering with “suggest” features</h2>
      <p>A user goes to a Web-based search engine and starts typing in
      Japanese, and with each keypress, the search engine starts giving a
      drop-down list of auto-completion suggestions. At the same time, the user’s
      <a href="#system-ime">system IME</a>
      has been invoked (by the user, in order for the user to type in
      Japanese) and also starts providing completion candidates for what
      the user has typed in—shown in a separate
      <a href="#candidate-window">candidate window</a>. But that candidate
      window appears <i>over</i> (in terms of Z-index) the drop-down list
      of auto-completion suggestions the Web-based search engine is displaying,
      making it impossible for the user to actually select any of the
      suggestions provided by the search engine.
      <p><b>Requirement</b>: Web developers should have a way to prevent a system
      IME from interfering with text input in their Web applications and
      from obscuring parts of their Web applications from which users are
      intended to make selections from suggestions based on what they type.
    </section>
    <section id="ime-interaction">
      <h2>[ime-interact] Get information back and forth from installed IMEs</h2>
      <p>Native applications running on devices are able to interact with the
      <a href="#system-ime">system IME</a>
      in useful ways, and are able to get information back and forth from them.
      Other third-party runtime environments also provide
      APIs for applications to interact with a system IME and user agents in
      useful ways. For example, ActionScript® 3.0 for the Adobe® Flash® Platform
      provides a
      <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/system/IME.html">flash.system.IME</a>
      interface with methods that let you
      “directly manipulate the operating system’s input
      method editor (IME) in the Flash runtime application that is running on a
      client computer. You can determine whether an IME is installed, whether or
      not the IME is currently enabled, and which IME is enabled. You can disable
      or enable the IME in the application, and you can perform other limited
      functions, depending on the operating system.”
      <p><b>Requirement</b>: Web applications should be able to get
      information back and forth from system IMEs and to otherwise interact
      with system IMEs—in a similar way to the ways in which native
      applications and third-party runtime applications can interact with
      system IMEs, including capabilities such as the following:
      <ul>
        <li>indicate to the user whether the Web application renders
        composition text by itself, or needs to ask user agents to render it</li>
        <li>determine the place where user agents render composition text</li>
        <li>detect whether the user agent renders
        <a href="#candidate-window">candidate windows</a>
        by themselves</li>
        <li>determine the place where user agents render
        <a href="#candidate-window">candidate windows</a></li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="custom-ime">
      <h2>[custom-ime] Enable a Web application to provide its own IME</h2>
      <p>Users of Web applications optimally want to have a user experience
      that is consistent within the application; for example, with text rendering
      and with text input displayed in a way that is consistent with the rest of
      the application’s UI, optimized for that specific application. The
      sudden appearance of a
      <a href="#system-ime">system IME</a> over an otherwise consistent,
      application-specific UI is jarring to the user experience, and
      detrimental to the overall integrity of the application.
      <p><b>Requirement</b>: For Web applications that require text input,
      Web developers should have the option to build and/or re-use
      (e.g., from a JS library) in-application
      IMEs—built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS—that enable the
      developers to control the look and feel of the IME in a way
      consistent with the UI theming of their applications, and to provide those
      IMEs as an integrated part of their applications, and not just be left to
      rely on whatever system IME might or might not be installed on the user’s
      system.
