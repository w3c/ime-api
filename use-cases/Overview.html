      <p>This is a non-normative document that provides background information
        relevant to the proposed

      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>An IME (input-method editor) is an application that allows a standard
        keyboard (such as a US-101 keyboard) to be used to type characters and
        symbols that are not directly represented on the keyboard itself.
        In China, Japan, and Korea, IMEs are used ubiquitously to enable
        standard keyboards to be employed to type the very large number
        of characters required for writing in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.
      </p>
      <p>Web-application developers currently encounter a number of
        <b>problems, pain points, and shortcomings related to interaction with
          operating-system IMEs</b>.
        The
        <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/ime-api/raw-file/default/Overview.html">IME API</a>
        addresses those issues, and this document describes use cases to which
        the IME API is applicable in addressing those issues.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="use-cases">
      <h2>Use cases</h2>
      <p>This section lists some use cases for the
        <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/ime-api/raw-file/default/Overview.html">IME API</a>.
      </p>

      <section id="editor">
        <h2>[editor] Give webapps developers power to build a DOM-based editor</h2>
        <p>For simple editing, <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> or
          <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> works, and
          <code>contenteditable</code> attribute is widely used for
          building a rich text editor.
          But when more minute control than
          <code>contenteditable</code> provides is required,
          a developer may go so far as to build a DOM-based editor without
          using <code>contenteditable</code>.
          There are several projects such as
          <a href="http://ace.ajax.org">ACE editor</a>
          which is widely used for popular services like
          <a href="https://c9.io">Cloud9</a>
          or
          <a href="https://gist.github.com">gist.github.com</a>,
          and
          <a href="http://codemirror.net">CodeMirror</a>,
          which is also widely used. Most building blocks for building such an
          editor like key events, composition events, and drawing arbitrary
          text are provided. But once IME is involved, for example, a webapp
          cannot draw composition text itself or control how composition text
          is drawn by the hosting user agent until the text is committed.
          It would be nice if webapps had an ability to draw composition
          text as native applications do as on-the-spot conversion.</p>
        <p><b>Requirement:</b> Developers of DOM-based editor should have a
          way to interact with and control the system IME to retrieve
          information about clauses of the composition text and
          prevent a user agent from drawing composition text.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="suggest">
        <h2>[suggest] Prevent system IME from interfering with “suggest” features</h2>
        <p>A user goes to a Web-based search engine and starts typing in
          Japanese, and with each keypress, the search engine starts giving a
          drop-down list of auto-completion suggestions. At the same time, the
          user’s
          <a href="../Overview.html#system-ime">system IME</a>
          has been invoked (by the user, in order for the user to type in
          Japanese) and also starts providing completion candidates for what
          the user has typed in—shown in a separate
          <a href="../Overview.html#candidate-window">candidate window</a>.
          But that candidate
          window appears <i>over</i> (in terms of Z-index) the drop-down list
          of auto-completion suggestions the Web-based search engine is
          displaying, making it impossible for the user to actually select any
          of the suggestions provided by the search engine.</p>
        <p><b>Requirement</b>: Web developers should have a way to prevent a
          system IME from interfering with text input in their Web
          applications and from obscuring parts of their Web applications from
          which users are intended to make selections from suggestions based
          on what they type.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="games">
        <h2>[games] Prevent system IME from interfering with games</h2>
        <p>A user who is playing a Web-based game might inadvertently press a
          key combination that would suddenly cause an
          <a href="../Overview.html#system-ime">system IME</a>
          to be invoked and then also possibly cause an IME
          <a href="../Overview.html#candidate-window">candidate window</a>
          to appear in the midst of that game. That wouldn’t be what the user
          would expect.
        </p>
        <p><b>Requirement</b>: Developers of Web-based game should have a way
          prevent the system IME from being invoked during a game.</p>
        <p>This use case in similar to the use case for providing the
          proposed
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/screen-orientation/">Screen Orientation Lock</a>
          API, or even the
          <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/pointerlock/raw-file/default/index.html">Pointer Lock</a> API,
          in that game developer should have a way to “lock” (out) the system
          IME behavior while the user is playing the game.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="ime-interaction">
        <h2>[ime-interact] Get information back and forth from installed IMEs</h2>
        <p>Native applications running on devices are able to interact with the
          <a href="../Overview.html#system-ime">system IME</a>
          in useful ways, and are able to get information back and forth from
          them.
          Other third-party runtime environments also provide
          APIs for applications to interact with a system IME and user agents
          in useful ways. For example, ActionScript® 3.0 for the Adobe® Flash®
          Platform provides a
          <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/system/IME.html">flash.system.IME</a>
          interface with methods that let you
          “directly manipulate the operating system’s inp method editor
          (IME) in the Flash runtime application that is running on a
          client computer. You can determine whether an IME is installed,
          whether or not the IME is currently enabled, and which IME is
          enabled. You can disable or enable the IME in the application,
          and you can perform other limited functions, depending on the
          operating system.”</p>
        <p><b>Requirement</b>: Web applications should be able to get
          information back and forth from system IMEs and to otherwise interact
          with system IMEs—in a similar way to the ways in which native
          applications and third-party runtime applications can interact with
          system IMEs, including capabilities such as the following:
          <ul>
            <li>indicate to the user whether the Web application renders
              composition text by itself, or needs to ask user agents to
              render it</li>
            <li>determine the place where user agents render composition
              text</li>
            <li>detect whether the user agent renders
              <a href="../Overview.html#candidate-window">candidate windows</a>
              by themselves</li>
            <li>determine the place where user agents render
              <a href="../Overview.html#candidate-window">candidate windows</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
